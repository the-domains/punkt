Have you ever wondered about the difference between a product and a piece of art? Art involves you in its creation. It does not exist outside of your experience of it. And most importantly, art offers you the opportunity to transcend the daily condition of "you" as a separate entity apart from the world and apart from others. 

What we have created transcends a physical product ("atoms and such"). We bring you the part without atoms. The part where the distinction between you and device and world, between now and past, is blurred. We have built a wonderful, special app -- whose purpose is to gently, and in harmony with you (your physiology, your being, your voice), produce a Sonic Lifefield(tm)---a living river of sound sculpture---that transmits to you the feelings of magic and experience and presence as imagined by some of the greatest artistic minds humanity has ever produced. 

We call our app Cadenza. It comes to life by following the rules of the ear and the brain, by being gentle, and by working with us, not against us. By following as closely as possible the rules of nature and biology, Cadenza delivers what is truly expressive, and truly an extension of your mind. 

Cadenza connects the present moment with brilliant creations of the past. With 200 year old music, with 30-year old recordings, and integrates this with your spontaneous expression in this singular moment. No headset required. No controller to master. No screen needed. Cadenza is pure AI and pure music. And Cadenza is real, you can use it right now. We have created the music performance platform for everyone, one of context, presence, intelligence, and experience. 

The technical bits are very cool and interesting and amazing. But we have also created something more. Cadenza is the result of really cool engineering and design -- but the emotion and feeling and joy comes from you: from a community of creative and curious people, from the greatest musicians and orchestras in the world, from ingenious composers like Bach, Beethoven and John Williams, and from everyone who has an idea, including you. Ideas, love, feeling, artisanship, care, and joy -- these come from everywhere and everyone. They are a part of all of us. 

Cadenza makes you, not machines, smarter, more engaged, happier. We empower and connected you to the world in a way that feels much more natural than playing your instrument by yourself or along with a frozen recording that has no awareness of your being. We are dreaming the same dreams that captivate you, ones that go beyond what we hear, and have heard. These are ancient yet modern dreams. We see these ideas in every culture, in music, books, films, paintings, and in our imaginations. 

Sonation contributes to a part of this collective imagination -- a new way to unlock our collective thoughts and passions and creative will simply by opening your heart and singing or playing your flute, or cello, or whatever you like. The parts that transcend atoms, the parts that make us thinking and feeling people; this is the most important part of our collective, creative future. Cadenza bends to your needs, makes us smarter, allows us in all ways to have a better and more complete musical experience, one of communication and sharing and enjoying. This is what we have worked hard to achieve, an ideal which becomes a life's work -- what we all at Sonation hope empowers you in each step we take on this journey together. 

We call it Cadenza, and it is just the beginning. Sonation's First Thing. We will bring the same freedom for expression and individual creation---connected with the virtual (the atom-less)---to new "Things" as we ramp up and work hard to unlock the supportive, human and intelligent potential of technology to improve, awaken, empower, enrich your experience. 

We hope that the fact that Sonation has already shipped its First Thing that truly frees people from atoms, yet forges connections based on individual expression and shared experience, will not go un-noticed by the tech investors who have gawked at the promise of Magic Leap, rubbing hands together in anticipation of a glorious new type of experience that is enabled and empowered by sophisticated technology, but that requires only that we be human to use it. 

In Sonation's case we have already arrived. Our technology requires no headset, indeed not even a screen. It sends the transformational signals directly into your brain, unmediated by screens, goggle, headsets or glasses. It's here now, and did not need 1.3 billion dollars of startup money to get here. Sonation's Next Thing will transform the already limited VR universe into a rich culture of limitless variation, expression, and emotional connection across users, language, location, and even across time.
